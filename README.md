# Roboshop Microservices Deployment using Ansible Roles

This repository contains a real-time implementation of **Ansible Roles** to automate the deployment of the **Roboshop microservices-based e-commerce application**.

> 🛠️ This project is inspired by actual infrastructure automation work I perform as a DevOps Engineer. It reflects real-world practices used to manage scalable, repeatable, and secure microservice deployments using Ansible.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Automate the deployment of each Roboshop microservice using Ansible roles
- Follow a **modular, reusable, and environment-agnostic structure**
- Secure secrets and credentials using **Ansible Vault**
- Make the deployment **scalable, maintainable, and production-ready**

---

## 🛒 What is Roboshop?

Roboshop is an open-source **e-commerce application** designed using a **microservices architecture**. Each component (frontend, user, payment, cart, etc.) runs independently and communicates over internal services.

### Microservices Managed:

- Catalogue
- Cart
- User
- Payment
- Shipping
- RabbitMQ
- Redis
- MongoDB
- MySQL
- Frontend (Nginx)

## 📚 Key Ansible Concepts Demonstrated

| Concept             | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Roles`             | Used for each microservice to modularize tasks                              |
| `Playbooks`         | Top-level execution files to call roles                                     |
| `Variables`         | `defaults`, `vars`, `group_vars`, `host_vars` for flexible config           |
| `Templates`         | Jinja2 templates for dynamic configuration files                            |
| `Handlers`          | Restarting services upon changes                                            |
| `Loops`             | Repeating tasks like package installation or user creation                  |
| `Tags`              | Enable partial playbook execution                                           |
| `Conditionals`      | Control task flow based on environment or state                             |
| `Ansible Vault`     | Secure secrets management (`db passwords`, `api keys`)                      |
| `Crontab`           | Schedule periodic jobs (optional but included where needed)                 |
| `Error Handling`    | Using `ignore_errors`, `failed_when`, and `block/rescue`                    |
